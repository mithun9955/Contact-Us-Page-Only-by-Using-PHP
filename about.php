                         <p>History (from Ancient Greek ἱστορία (historía) 'inquiry; knowledge acquired by 
                            investigation')[1] is the study and the documentation of the past.[2][3] Events before the
                             invention of writing systems are considered prehistory.[4] "History" is an umbrella term 
                             comprising past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization,
                              presentation, and interpretation of these events. Historians seek knowledge of the 
                              past using historical sources such as written documents, oral accounts, art and material 
                              artifacts, and ecological markers.[5]
                                History is also an academic discipline which uses narrative to describe, examine, question, and analyze past
                                events, and investigate their patterns of cause and effect.[6][7] Historians often debate which narrative best
                                explains an event, as well as the significance of different causes and effects. Historians also debate the nature 
                                of history as an end in itself, as well as its usefulness to give perspective on the problems of the present.
                                [6][8][9][10]

                                Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales
                                surrounding King Arthur), are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends.[11][12] History 
                                differs from myth in that it is supported by verifiable evidence. However, ancient cultural influences 
                                have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries
                                and continue to change today. The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of
                                specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematic elements of historical investigation.
                                    History is often taught as a
                                part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a major discipline
                                in university studies.
